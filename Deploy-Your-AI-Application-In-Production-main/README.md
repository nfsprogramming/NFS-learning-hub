# Deploy Your AI Application In Production

Stand up a complete, production-ready AI application environment in Azure with a single command. This solution accelerator provisions Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft Fabric, Azure AI Search, and connects to your tenant level Microsoft Purview (when resourceId is provided) —all pre-wired with private networking, managed identities, and governance controls—so you can move from proof-of-concept to production in hours instead of weeks.

Solution Overview
</h2>

This accelerator extends the [AI Landing Zone](https://github.com/Azure/ai-landing-zone) reference architecture to deliver an enterprise-scale, production-ready foundation for deploying secure AI applications and agents in Azure. It packages Microsoft's Well-Architected Framework principles around networking, identity, and operations from day zero.

### How to install or deploy

Follow the deployment guide to deploy this solution to your own Azure subscription.

> **Note:** This solution accelerator requires **Azure Developer CLI (azd) version 1.15.0 or higher**. [Download azd here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

>  **Important: This repository uses git submodules**
> <br/>Clone with submodules included:
> ```bash
> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/Deploy-Your-AI-Application-In-Production.git
> ```
> If you already cloned without submodules, run:
> ```bash
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```
> **GitHub Codespaces and Dev Containers handle this automatically.**

>  **Windows shell note**
> <br/>Preprovision uses `shell: sh`. Run `azd` from Git Bash/WSL so `bash` is available, or switch the `preprovision` hook in `azure.yaml` to the provided PowerShell script if you want to stay in PowerShell.

<br/>

>  **Important: Check Azure OpenAI Quota Availability**
> <br/>To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow the [quota check instructions guide](./docs/quota_check.md) before deploying.

  <summary><b>Click to see prerequisites</b></summary>

  | Requirement | Details |
  |-------------|---------|
  | **Azure Subscription** | Owner or Contributor + User Access Administrator permissions |
  | **Microsoft Fabric** | Optional. Either access to create capacity/workspace, or provide existing Fabric capacity/workspace IDs, or disable Fabric automation |
  | **Microsoft Purview** | Existing tenant-level Purview account (or ability to create one) |
  | **Azure CLI** | Version 2.61.0 or later |
  | **Azure Developer CLI** | Version 1.15.0 or later |
  | **Quota** | Sufficient Azure OpenAI quota ([check here](./docs/quota_check.md)) |

  > **Note:** Fabric automation is optional. To disable all Fabric automation, set `fabricCapacityPreset = 'none'` and `fabricWorkspacePreset = 'none'` in `infra/main.bicepparam`.

  > **Note:** If you enable Fabric capacity deployment (`fabricCapacityPreset='create'`), you must supply at least one valid Fabric capacity admin principal (Entra user UPN email or object ID) via `fabricCapacityAdmins`.

  > **Note:** If you enable Fabric provisioning (`fabricWorkspacePreset='create'`), the user running `azd` must have the **Fabric Administrator** role (or equivalent Fabric/Power BI tenant admin permissions) to call the required admin APIs.

<br/>

### Key Features

<details open>
  <summary><b>Click to learn more about key features</b></summary>

  - **Production-grade AI Foundry deployments**
    <br/>Stand up Azure AI Foundry projects in a locked-down virtual network with private endpoints, managed identities, and telemetry aligned to the Well-Architected Framework.

  - **Fabric-powered retrieval workflows**
    <br/>Land documents in a Fabric lakehouse, index them with OneLake + Azure AI Search, and wire the index into the Foundry playground for grounded chat experiences.

  - **Governed data and agent operations**
    <br/>Integrate Microsoft Purview for cataloging, scoped scans, and Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) so compliance teams can monitor the same assets the app consumes.

  - **Extensible AVM-driven platform**
    <br/>Toggle additional Azure services (API Management, Cosmos DB, SQL, and more) through AI Landing Zone parameters to tailor the environment for broader intelligent app scenarios.

  - **Launch-ready demos and pilots**
    <br/>Publish experiences from Azure AI Foundry directly to a browser-based application, giving stakeholders an end-to-end view from infrastructure to user-facing app.

</details>

<br/>

### Sample Workflow

1. **Deploy infrastructure** → Run `azd up` to provision all resources (~45 minutes)
2. **Upload documents** → Add PDFs to the Fabric bronze lakehouse
3. **Index content** → OneLake indexer automatically populates AI Search
4. **Test in playground** → Connect Foundry to the search index and chat with your data
5. **Publish application** → Deploy the chat experience to end users
6. **Monitor governance** → Review data lineage and security posture in Purview

### Security Guidelines

<details>
  <summary><b>Click to see security best practices</b></summary>

  This template leverages [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) between services to eliminate credential management.

  **Recommendations:**
  - Enable [GitHub secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) on your repository
  - Consider enabling [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/)
  - Review the [AI Foundry security documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/)

  > ⚠️ **Important:** This template is built to showcase Azure services. Implement additional security measures before production use.
